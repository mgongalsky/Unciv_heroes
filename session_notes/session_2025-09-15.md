# Development Session - September 15, 2025

## Session Overview

Today's session focused on implementing UI improvements and notification systems for hero feeding mechanics. We completed two major features:

1. **Hero Feeding UI Refactoring** - Moving hero feeding functionality into collapsible expander tabs
2. **Low Food Warning System** - Implementing notifications when units are running low on food

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Hero Feeding UI Refactoring

**Problem**: Hero feeding interface was taking up too much space on the city screen
**Solution**: Created collapsible ExpanderTab system similar to other city screen sections

**Key Files Modified**:
- `core/src/com/unciv/ui/cityscreen/HeroFeedingTable.kt` (NEW) - Extracted hero feeding logic
- `core/src/com/unciv/ui/cityscreen/CityStatsTable.kt` - Cleaned up, removed 200+ lines of hero feeding code

**Architecture Decision**: Followed existing pattern used by `CitizenManagementTable` and `SpecialistAllocationTable`
- Used `ExpanderTab` with `asExpander()` method
- Default state: open (`startsOutOpened = true`)
- Persistence ID: `"CityStatsTable.HeroFeeding"`

**Key Implementation Details**:
```kotlin
fun asExpander(onChange: (() -> Unit)?): ExpanderTab {
    return ExpanderTab(
        title = "{Hero Feeding}",
        fontSize = Constants.defaultFontSize,
        persistenceID = "CityStatsTable.HeroFeeding",
        startsOutOpened = true,
        onChange = onChange
    ) {
        it.add(this)
        update()
    }
}
```

### 2. Low Food Warning Notification System

**Problem**: Players could lose units due to starvation without warning
**Solution**: Implemented proactive notification system when units have ≤3 turns of food remaining

**Key Files Modified**:
- `core/src/com/unciv/logic/map/MapUnit.kt` - Added warning logic to `startTurn()`
- `core/src/com/unciv/logic/civilization/Notification.kt` - Added `HeroAction` for unit focus

**Technical Implementation**:
- Check occurs every turn in `MapUnit.startTurn()` for units outside cities
- Calculation: `daysRemaining = (currentFood / dailyConsumption).toInt()`
- Warning threshold: ≤ 3 days remaining

**Notification Messages**:
- 0 days: "[UnitName] has no food left!"
- 1 day: "[UnitName] has food for only 1 turn!"
- 2-3 days: "[UnitName] has food for only X turns!"

**UI Integration**:
- Uses `NotificationIcon.Death` for urgency
- Clicking notification centers map on unit and selects it
- Custom `HeroAction` class handles focus behavior

## Architecture Insights Discovered

### 1. ExpanderTab System
- Unciv has a well-established pattern for collapsible UI sections
- Key components: `ExpanderTab`, `asExpander()` method, persistence IDs
- Pattern: Create separate Table class, then wrap with ExpanderTab in parent
- State persistence handled automatically by ExpanderTab system

### 2. Notification System Architecture
- Three main components: icon, text, and action
- Standard icons available in `NotificationIcon` object
- Actions implement `NotificationAction` interface with `execute(worldScreen)` method
- Actions must be serializable (`IsPartOfGameInfoSerialization`)

### 3. Unit State Management
- All units have food consumption calculated by `army.calculateFoodMaintenance()`
- Units outside cities (`!currentTile.isCityCenter()`) are considered "in campaign"
- Food warnings make sense only for units in campaign mode

### 4. Turn Processing Order
- Units process in specific order during turn start
- `MapUnit.startTurn()` called for each unit from `CivilizationInfo.startTurn()`
- Good place to add per-unit per-turn logic

## Technical Gotchas and Solutions

### 1. Notification Method Signatures
**Problem**: Initially used wrong `addNotification()` signature
**Solution**: Correct format is `addNotification(text, action, ...icons)`

### 2. Unit Selection in Notifications  
**Problem**: Tried to directly set `bottomUnitTable.selectedUnit` (not allowed)
**Solution**: Use `bottomUnitTable.tileSelected(heroTile)` to properly select unit

### 3. Hero Identification
**Issue**: Initially tried to filter with `baseUnit.name.contains("Hero")` but heroes don't exist as separate unit type yet
**Current State**: All units get food warnings, which is actually beneficial for now

### 4. Percentage Calculation Bug
**Problem**: Found bug in auto-feed logic using non-existent `toPercent()` method
**Fix**: Changed `maxFoodHero *= totalBonusPercent.toPercent()` to `maxFoodHero *= (1f + totalBonusPercent / 100f)`

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Hero feeding logic properly separated into dedicated class
- CityStatsTable became much cleaner and more focused
- Easier to maintain and extend hero feeding features

### 2. Consistent UI Patterns
- Followed existing ExpanderTab patterns exactly
- Maintains UI consistency across the game
- Users get familiar interaction patterns

### 3. User Experience
- Notification messages are concise but informative
- Visual urgency (Death icon) draws attention to critical issues
- Click-to-focus provides immediate actionable response

## Debug Process Notes

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Added debug logging** to understand system behavior
2. **Ran game with debug output** to see actual unit processing
3. **Discovered** that warnings were being sent but for all units
4. **Confirmed** system was working as intended
5. **Cleaned up** debug output and finalized implementation

### Key Debugging Commands Used
```kotlin
println("Unit startTurn: ${baseUnit.name}, currentFood: $currentFood")
println("dailyConsumption: $dailyConsumption")  
println("daysRemaining: $daysRemaining")
println("Sending food warning notification: $warningText")
```

## Future Considerations

### 1. Hero System Evolution
- Current implementation treats all units as potential "heroes"
- When true hero system is implemented, can easily filter with proper hero identification
- Food warning system will work seamlessly with future hero classes

### 2. Notification Frequency
- Currently sends warning every turn when food ≤ 3 days
- May want to implement "already warned" tracking to avoid spam
- Could show different urgency levels (3 days vs 1 day vs 0 days)

### 3. UI Improvements
- Could add notification settings to let players customize warning thresholds
- Might benefit from different notification icons for different urgency levels

## Files Created/Modified Summary

**New Files**:
- `session_notes/` directory structure
- `core/src/com/unciv/ui/cityscreen/HeroFeedingTable.kt`

**Modified Files**:
- `core/src/com/unciv/ui/cityscreen/CityStatsTable.kt` - Major cleanup, removed hero feeding code
- `core/src/com/unciv/logic/map/MapUnit.kt` - Added food warning system
- `core/src/com/unciv/logic/civilization/Notification.kt` - Added HeroAction class  
- `core/src/com/unciv/logic/city/CityInfo.kt` - Fixed percentage calculation bug

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check existing patterns** before implementing new UI components
2. **Debug with actual game runs** rather than just code analysis
3. **Notification systems require careful attention to method signatures**
4. **UI refactoring can significantly improve code maintainability**
5. **Proactive warning systems greatly improve user experience**

## Next Session Preparation

- The codebase now has clean, extensible hero feeding UI
- Warning system is in place and working
- Both systems ready for future hero system integration
- Consider implementing notification frequency control
- May want to explore other areas needing similar UI improvements
